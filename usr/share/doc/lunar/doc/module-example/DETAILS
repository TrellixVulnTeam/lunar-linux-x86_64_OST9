# DETAILS example
#

# This demonstrates how to put in every possible parameter in a DETAILS
# file. Note that not everything is required, but a minimum is:

# MODULE		name of the module, identical to the name if the
#			directory it resides in
# VERSION		current version number of the package
# SOURCE		the name of the source file
# SOURCE_DIRECTORY	the name of where the source will unpack
# SOURCE_URL[0]		the name of source file
# WEBSITE		the main website of the package
# ENTERED		the date (format yyyymmdd) when it was added
# UPDATED		tha date (format yyyymmdd) when a recompile 
#			was needed
# SHORT			a one line description

# and of course the long description that looks like this:
#	cat << EOF
#	blablablabla
#	....
#	EOF


# here's an example with some comments and additions:
#           MODULE=pure-ftpd
#          VERSION=1.0.12
#           SOURCE=$MODULE-$VERSION.tar.gz
# SOURCE_DIRECTORY=$BUILD_DIRECTORY/$MODULE-$VERSION
#    SOURCE_URL[0]=http://telia.dl.sourceforge.net/pureftpd/$SOURCE
#         WEB_SITE=http://www.pureftpd.org
#          ENTERED=20010922
#          UPDATED=20020609
#       MAINTAINER=maintaner@moongroup.com
#            SHORT="An efficient, lightweight, and secure FTP server"
# cat << EOF
