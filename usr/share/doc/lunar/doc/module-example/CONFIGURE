# CONFIGURE example
#

# showstopper example: this is for the gcc3 module, which can possibly
# ruin your box. This example shows a neat way of bailing out elegantly:
#	WARNING_SIGN=${MESSAGE_COLOR}"Caution, installation of gcc3 can severly damage a working stable system.  Installation on a mission critial box is not recomended at this point."
#	message $WARNING_SIGN
#
#	query  "Are you sure you want to install?" n


# complex example showing the ability of lunar to store and re-use
# previous configuration settings:
#	if  !  grep  -q  CONFIGURED  $MODULE_CONFIG;  then
#	
#	  if    query  "Do you want to disable banner? " y
#	      then OPTS=$OPTS" --without-banner"
#	  fi
#	
#	  if    query  "Do you want to enable large file support? " y
#	      then OPTS=$OPTS" --with-largefile"
#	  fi
#	
#	   echo  'CONFIGURED="y"'  >>  $MODULE_CONFIG
#	   echo  'OPTS='\"$OPTS\"    >>  $MODULE_CONFIG
#	fi
