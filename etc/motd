Welcome to Lunar Linux 1.8.0-testing-20190605-x86_64 (Mare Incognitum)!

Read `man lfirsttime` if you are a new Lunar Linux user. It contains
many hints that are useful if you do not know what to do next. Read
`man lunar` about the Lunar Linux package management system, to find
out how to install additional packages. Also read the "/root/README"
file for more hints on what you can do with the ISO itself in case
of problems.

You are reading the contents of "/etc/motd". If you do not edit or
remove it, it will continue to bug you with this message.
