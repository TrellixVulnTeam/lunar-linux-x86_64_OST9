Baloo allows you to search for local files based on a query language. This language
mostly consists of (key: value) pairs which can be ANDed or ORed together to create
complex queries.

The Query interface provides a convenient API for clients to write queries which
form a tree like syntax of terms which can be ANDed and ORed together. Each term
comprises of a property name, a value and a comparison operator.
