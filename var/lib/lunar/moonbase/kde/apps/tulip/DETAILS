The research by the information visualization community shows clearly that using
a visual representation of data-sets enables faster analysis by the end users.
Tulip, created by David AUBER, is a contribution of the area of information
visualization. Even if the Tulip framework allows the visualization, the drawing
and the edition of small graphs, all the parts of the framework have been built
in order to be able to visualize graphs having more than 1.000.000 elements.
Such a visualization system must draw and display huge graphs, allows the
navigation through geometric operations as well as the extraction of subgraphs
and the enhancement of the results obtained by filtering.
