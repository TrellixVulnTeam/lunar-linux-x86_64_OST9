QCheckers (formely known as KCheckers) is a Qt-based checkers board game.
It can play english draughts and russian draughts.
For storing the positions of games QCheckers uses the Portable Draughts
Notation (PDN) database format. It is used by many other checkers programs,
and is becoming the standard way to swap games.
PDN is based on the Portable Game Notation (PGN) standard which is widely used
for Chess. For details see http://www.chessandcheckers.com/pdn.htm
