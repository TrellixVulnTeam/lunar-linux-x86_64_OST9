cat << EOF
Displays various information about a WaveLAN device:
* Signal state (tells if a carrier signal was detected)
* Signal quality (current quality of the carrier signal)
    Note that the latter is in % on Linux and in dBm on BSDs. Hence, on BSDs, the
    progressbar may be never full, as dBm is not easily comparable to a maximum.
* Network name (current SSID of the WaveLAN network).
