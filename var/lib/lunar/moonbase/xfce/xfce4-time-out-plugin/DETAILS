cat << EOF
xfce4-time-out-plugin is a plugin for the Xfce panel. It's a 
comfortable tool for taking a break from computer work every now 
and then. You can define a working interval and whenever time
of this interval has passed your screen is locked for a configurable
amount of time - which gives you enough time to grab a cup of 
coffee, smoke a cigarette or even do something healthy like eating, 
exercising, cleaning up or whatever.
