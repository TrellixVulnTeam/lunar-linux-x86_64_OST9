           SHORT="Enterprise-class stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux"

cat << EOF
eCryptfs is a cryptographic stacked Linux filesystem. eCryptfs stores
cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that
encrypted files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decrypted
with the proper key in the Linux kernel keyring.
There is no need to keep track of any additional information aside from
what is already in the encrypted file itself. You may think of eCryptfs
as a sort of "gnupgfs", or "gnupg as a filesystem".
