The container technology is actively being pushed into the mainstream linux
kernel. It provides the resource management through the control groups aka
process containers and resource isolation through the namespaces.

The linux containers, lxc, aims to use these new functionalities to provide an
userspace container object which provides full resource isolation and resource
control for an application or a system.

The first objective of this project is to make the life easier for the kernel
developers involved in the containers project and especially to continue working
on the Checkpoint/Restart new features. The lxc is small enough to easily manage
a container with simple command lines and complete enough to be used for other
purposes.
