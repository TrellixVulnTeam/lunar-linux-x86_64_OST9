cat << EOF
Dansguardian filters the actual content of pages based on many methods
including phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL filtering. It does
not purely filter based on a banned list of sites like lesser totally
commercial filters.

DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to
tailor the filtering to your exact needs. It can be as draconian or as
unobstructive as you want. The default settings are geared towards what
a primary school might want but DansGuardian puts you in control of what
you want to block.
