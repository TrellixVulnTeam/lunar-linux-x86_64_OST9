cat << EOF
GNU libxmi is a C/C++ function library for rasterizing 2-D vector graphics. It
can draw 2-D graphical primitives, including wide polygonal lines and circular
and elliptical arcs, into a user-supplied matrix of pixels. Sophisticated line
styles, such as multicolored dashing patterns, can be specified. There is also
support for filling and texturing polygons.
