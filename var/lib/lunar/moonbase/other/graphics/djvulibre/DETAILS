DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing documents
and images. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG, and GIF for
distributing scanned documents, digital documents, or high-resolution pictures.
DjVu content downloads faster, displays and renders faster, looks nicer on a
screen, and consume less client resources than competing formats. DjVu images
display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned with no lengthy
re-rendering. DjVu is used by hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental,
and non-commercial web sites around the world.
