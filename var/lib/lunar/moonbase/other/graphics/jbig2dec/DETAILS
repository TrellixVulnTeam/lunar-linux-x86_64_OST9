cat << EOF
jbig2dec is a decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression
format. JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel'
(1-bit monochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and in
particular scanned paper documents. In this domain it is very
efficient, offering compression ratios on the order of 100:1.
