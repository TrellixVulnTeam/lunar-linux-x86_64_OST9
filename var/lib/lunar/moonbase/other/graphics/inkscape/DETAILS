cat << EOF
Inkscape seeks to become a full featured open source SVG editor. Derived from
the highly popular Sodipodi codebase, Inkscape strives to build full XML, SVG,
and CSS2 compliance, convert the codebase from C/Gtk to C++/Gtkmm, emphasizes a
lightweight core with powerful features added through an extension mechanism,
and promotes friendly, open, community-oriented development processes.
