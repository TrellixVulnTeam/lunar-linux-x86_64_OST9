cat << EOF
The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio. Like MP3, Vorbis, and AAC
it is suitable for transmitting music with high quality. Unlike these formats
CELT imposes very little delay on the signal, even less than is typical for
speech centric formats like Speex, GSM, or G.729.
CELT stands for "Constrained Energy Lapped Transform". It applies some of the
CELP principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some
of the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for both speech and music and
currently features:
  Ultra-low latency (typically from 5 to 22.5 ms)
  Full audio bandwidth (â‰¥20kHz; sample rates from 8 kHz to 48 kHz)
  Support for both speech and music
  A quality/bitrate trade-off competitive with widely used high delay codecs
  Stereo support
  Packet loss concealment
  Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above
  A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder
The CELT codec is meant to bridge the gap between Vorbis and Speex for
applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.
