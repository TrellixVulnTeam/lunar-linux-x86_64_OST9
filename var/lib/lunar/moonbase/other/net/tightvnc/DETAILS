TightVNC is a VNC distribution with many new features, improvements,
and bugfixes over VNC. It is optimized for faster operation on slow
network links such as modem connections, provides more configuration
options in the server, features automatic SSH tunneling in the Unix
vncviewer, and more. The modified servers and viewers are fully
compatible with the original VNC software.
