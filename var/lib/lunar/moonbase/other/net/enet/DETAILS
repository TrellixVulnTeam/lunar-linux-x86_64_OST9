cat <<EOF
ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust
network communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The
primary feature it provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery
of packets.

ENet omits certain higher level networking features such as
authentication, lobbying, server discovery, encryption, or other
similar tasks that are particularly application specific so that the
library remains flexible, portable, and easily embeddable.
