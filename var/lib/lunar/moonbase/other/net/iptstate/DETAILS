cat << EOF
IPTState is a top-like interface to your netfilter connection-tracking table.
Using iptstate you interactively watch where traffic crossing your netfilter/
iptables firewall is going, sort by various criteria, limit the view by various
criteria. You can even delete states from the table.
Features include:
  Top-like realtime state table information
  Sorting by any field
  Reversible sorting
  Single display of state table
  Customizable refresh rate
  Display filtering
  Color-coding
  Open Source (specifically I'm using the zlib license)
  much more...
