cat << EOF
The rdate utility retrieves the date and time from another machine on your
network, using the protocol described in RFC 868. If you run rdate as root,
it will set your machine's local time to the time of the machine that you
queried. Note that rdate isn't scrupulously accurate. If you are worried about
milliseconds, install the ntp module, which includes the ntpd daemon, instead.
