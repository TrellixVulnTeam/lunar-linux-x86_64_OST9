This is a very useful little utility which will help
bashers add and subtract dates! It hasn't changed in 
a very, very long time and I believe it is in the
public domain now.

The author, Gordon A. Runkle, did not assign any sort 
of license to the code that I can find. If, at some 
point in the future we discover that this software is 
not in the public domain we will, of course, remove
it from Lunar Linux.
