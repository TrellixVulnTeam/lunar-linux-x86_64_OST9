cat << EOF
Cheetah3 is a free and open source template engine and code-generation tool
written in Python. Cheetah can be used unto itself, or incorporated with other
technologies and stacks regardless of whether theyâ€™re written in Python or not.
At its core, Cheetah is a domain-specific language for markup generation and
templating which allows for full integration with existing Python code but also
offers extensions to traditional Python syntax to allow for easier
text-generation.
