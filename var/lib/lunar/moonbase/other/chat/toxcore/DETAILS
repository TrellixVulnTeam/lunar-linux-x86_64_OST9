cat << EOF
An instant messaging protocol that ran without any kind of central servers.
The system would be distributed, peer-to-peer, and encrypted end-to-end, with
no way to disable any of the encryption features; at the same time, the
protocol would be easily usable by the layperson with no practical knowledge
of cryptography or distributed systems.
