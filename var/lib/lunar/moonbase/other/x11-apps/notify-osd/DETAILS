The freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification provides a standard way
for applications to display pop-up notifications. These are designed to make
you aware of something, without interrupting your work with a window you must
close.
Notify OSD presents these notifications as ephemeral overlays, which can be
clicked through so they don't block your work. It queues notifications, to
prevent them from flooding your screen.
