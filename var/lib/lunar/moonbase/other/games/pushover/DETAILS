Pushover is a faithful reimplementation of the game
with the same name published in 1992 by Ocean. It
contains the original levels. The graphics and sound
are very similar when compared with the original game.

The task of the game is to rearrange the dominoes on
the different platforms so that you can start a chain-
reaction that makes all dominoes topple over.
