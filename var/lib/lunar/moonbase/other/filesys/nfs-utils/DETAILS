The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines to mount a disk
partition on a remote machine as if it were on a local hard drive. This allows
for fast, seamless sharing of files across a network.
It also gives the potential for unwanted people to access your hard drive over
the network (and thereby possibly read your email and delete all your files as
well as break into your system) if you set it up incorrectly. So please read
the Security section of the NFS-HOWTO carefully if you intend to implement an
NFS setup.
