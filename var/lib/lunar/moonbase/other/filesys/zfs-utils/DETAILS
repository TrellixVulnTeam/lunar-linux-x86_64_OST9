cat << EOF
ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager which was originally developed
for Solaris.
It has been successfully ported to FreeBSD and now there is a functional Linux
ZFS kernel port too. The port currently includes a fully functional and stable
SPA, DMU, and ZVOL with a ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) on the way.
