cat << EOF
The wmctrl program is a UNIX/Linux command line tool to interact with an
EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.
The tool provides command line access to almost all the features defined in the
EWMH specification. It can be used, for example, to obtain information about the
window manager, to get a detailed list of desktops and managed windows, to
switch and resize desktops, to make windows full-screen, always-above or sticky,
and to activate, close, move, resize, maximize and minimize them.
The command line access to these window management functions makes it easy to
automate and execute them from any application that is able to run a command in
response to an event.
Please note that wmctrl only works with window managers which implement the EWMH
specification.
