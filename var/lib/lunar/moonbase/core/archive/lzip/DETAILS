cat << EOF
Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe
integrity checking and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2.
Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses better than bzip2,
which makes it well suited for software distribution and data archiving.
